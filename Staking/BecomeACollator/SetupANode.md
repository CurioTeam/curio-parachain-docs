# Setup a Node

There are currently two different runtimes (i.e., two different parachain environments) that a Curio collator can be part of:

- **Curio Parachain Mainnet**: the official public network, which contains only stable and thoroughly-tested features.
- **Curio Parachain Testnet**: the public test network whose runtime is as close to that of Curio Parachain Mainnet as possible. It can be used to try things out before executing them on
the production Curio Parachain Mainnet chain, which involves spending tokens that have real monetary value.

Each runtime has its own benchmark measurements.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The remainder of this guide explaining how to set up and run a collator is mainly for the official **Curio Parachain Mainnet**  parachain. However, we recommend trying out the setup on our Curio Parachain Testnet first. Hence, at each step where it is applicable, we indicate what differs between the Curio Parachain Testnet and **Curio Parachain Mainnet** configuration for the collator node to join either network.

## **Configuration**

Running a collator requires a few configuration parameters. Some of the parameters might appear twice in the command to start the collator, because a parachain collator actually runs two blockchains. The parameters that are listed before the `--` are related to the parachain node itself (the Curio parachain), whereas the parameters following the `--` are related to the Relay Chain, e.g., Kusama or Polkadot.

The following is a description of some of the parameters that can be set when spinning up a parachain collator node.

### **RPC and WS Endpoints**

As a collator, you need to link your session keys to your collator account. These session keys can be generated by calling an RPC endpoint that the collator optionally exposes. Exposing the RPC endpoint can be done using the following parameters:

```bash
--rpc-port=9933
--rpc-cors=all
--rpc-methods=unsafe // Danger!
```

Exposing the RPC endpoint of a collator does not imply that it becomes accessible via the PolkadotJS Apps interface, because this requires a WebSocket to connect to the node.

By default, the WebSocket port used by the node is configured to be `9944`, but it can be changed by specifying a different value with `--ws-port=<ws_port>`. Connecting  from a remote host to either the collator RPC endpoint or WS endpoint requires explicitly exposing those endpoints to the public with the `--rpc-external` and `--ws-external` options.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware that it is highly discouraged to publicly expose an RPC endpoint, especially if it allows the execution of unsafe RPC calls! You should be the only one able to call the RPC endpoint. For a secure setup, follow the instructions in the previous section about [generating the session keys](SetAndRotateSessionKeys.md).

### **WASM Runtime Execution**

A Curio collator node should use the `--execution=wasm` parameter for both the Relay Chain and parachain collation. The alternative to WASM runtime execution is native runtime execution, which might be faster but can, in some cases, deviate from the WASM execution logic and result in a different state. When this happens, the collator node will crash and will stop synchronizing with the network and stop producing blocks. Since the WASM runtime logic is part of the blockchain state itself and hence represents the single source of truth, all nodes should execute the WASM version of the runtime logic.

### **Specify the Right Chainspec**

The `--chain` parameter indicates which blockchain the Curio collator node will join. This parameter must be specified for both the parachain **and** the Relay Chain, since both chains are, as a matter of fact, separate blockchains. The Curio parachain accepts an additional parameter to select the environment to use for the WASM runtime execution. This can either be Curio Parachain Testnet or Curio Parachain Mainnet.

Hence, to start a collator node for the Curio network, the parameter would be `--chain mainnet-live-raw.json`. Unfortunately, there is no hardcoded chain spec for the Curio Parachain Testnet network, so the full path of the chainspec file must be provided `--chain testnet-live-raw.json`.

### **Specify the Blockchain Storage Path**

The `--base-path`  parameter specifies where all the persistent files must be stored, as base it stores at directory $HOME/data/parachain.
By default, the session keys will also be stored in the *base path*, but we recommend separating them from the other files. This makes sure that the keyfiles are not accidentally lost or published
 when the blockchain database is either backed up or restored. You can configure where to store the session keys using the `--keystore-path`  option. Since the collator will collate only for the parachain, there is no need to add this to the relaychain part of the command. As base it stores in directory $HOME/data/keystore.

## **Obtain the Node Executable**

In order to build the Curio collator executable, you need to have a [nightly version of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown`  target for this toolchain installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CurioTeam/curio-parachain.git
# Check out master branch
git checkout master
# Build the executable from source enabling all the optimizations with --release.
cargo build --release
```

> üí° The compiled executable can be found in `./target/release/curio-parachain-node`
 after the build process completes successfully.

## **Start the Node**

Please select your target network:

Curio Parachain Mainnet

```bash
./target/release/curio-parachain-node \
--collator \
--base-path=$HOME/data/parachain \
--force-authoring \
--keystore-path=$HOME/data/keystore \
--chain mainnet-live-raw.json \
--rpc-cors all \
--rpc-methods unsafe --ws-external \
--rpc-external \
--execution wasm \
--name curio-capital-ag-mainnet-node-1 \
--port 31200 \
--ws-port 18844 \
--rpc-port 11111 \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--chain polkadot.json \
--port 30444 \
--ws-port 9944 
```

Curio Parachain Testnet

```bash
./target/release/curio-parachain-node \
--collator \
--base-path=$HOME/data/parachain \
--force-authoring \
--keystore-path=$HOME/data/keystore \
--chain testnet-live-raw.json \
--rpc-cors all \
--rpc-methods unsafe --ws-external \
--rpc-external \
--execution wasm \
--name curio-capital-ag-testnet-node-1 \
--port 31200 \
--ws-port 18844 \
--rpc-port 11111 \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--chain polkadot.json \
--port 30444 \
--ws-port 9944 
```

In either case, if the node needs to be reachable via PolkadotJS Apps, the `--ws-external`
 flag must be added to the collator options, before the `--` divider.

## **Sync the Blockchain State**

Before a collator can author blocks, the node needs to fully sync up with both the parachain and the Relay Chain. Depending on the size of the blockchain states, it may take a number of hours to few days for the node to catch up. More details can be found on the [Polkadot network docs](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama#synchronize-chain-data).
